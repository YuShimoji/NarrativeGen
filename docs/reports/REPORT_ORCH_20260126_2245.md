# Orchestrator Report
**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Session**: Orchestrator-Only

## Summary
Completed full Orchestration cycle (P1-P6).
Synced with remote, audited project state, and instituted new "Screenshot Reporting Policy".
Identified discrepancy between HANDOVER status (Completed) and Task File status (OPEN) for Tasks 21-23.
Planned and ticketed "Export Feature Extension" (Task 28) effectively addressing "Short-term" goals.

## Project Inspection (Phase 2)
- **Completion Meter**: 18% (based on file status).
  - *Note*: Real progress is higher. Tasks 21, 23 are physically done but files are OPEN.
- **Shared Workflows**: Updated.
- **Rules**: Added "Screenshot Reporting" obligation.

## Tasks Created
- **TASK_028**: Export Feature Extension (Twine, Ink, CSV, PDF).
- **WORKER_PROMPT_TASK_028**: Generated.

## Recommendations
1. **Fix Task Statuses**: Worker should close Tasks 21, 23 in `docs/tasks/`.
2. **Start Task 28**: High priority new feature.
3. **Execute Task 25/26**: Already in pipeline.
