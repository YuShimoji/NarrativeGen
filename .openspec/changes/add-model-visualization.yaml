description: Add visual model visualization to web-tester as alternative to removed D3 graphs
component: web-tester
priority: medium
status: proposed

requirements:
  - Display node relationships as interactive graph
  - Support zoom and pan functionality
  - Show node connections and choice targets
  - Integrate with existing model data structure
  - Provide fallback for when graph cannot be displayed

implementation_plan:
  - Create SVG-based graph rendering module
  - Add graph tab back to web-tester UI
  - Implement force-directed layout algorithm
  - Add zoom/pan controls with mouse/touch support
  - Connect graph nodes to model editing functionality

testing_requirements:
  - Graph renders correctly for sample models
  - Zoom/pan works on different screen sizes
  - Node selection updates model editor
  - Performance acceptable for models with 50+ nodes

acceptance_criteria:
  - Visual graph displays node relationships
  - Interactive navigation possible
  - Integration with existing GUI editor
  - No impact on build performance
