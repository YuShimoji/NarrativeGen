description: Implement drag and drop functionality for nodes in the graph visualization
component: web-tester
priority: medium
status: proposed

requirements:
  - Add drag and drop to graph SVG elements
  - Update node positions dynamically
  - Save layout changes to model
  - Prevent overlapping and maintain readability

implementation_plan:
  - Add SVG drag event handlers to node circles
  - Implement position calculation and collision detection
  - Update graph rendering to reflect new positions
  - Add save/reset layout buttons

testing_requirements:
  - Drag nodes to new positions
  - Layout persists across sessions
  - No overlapping nodes after drag
  - Performance remains smooth

acceptance_criteria:
  - Nodes can be dragged and repositioned
  - Layout is saved and restored
  - Graph remains readable after changes
  - No performance degradation
