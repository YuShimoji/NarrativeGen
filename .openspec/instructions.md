# NarrativeGen OpenSpec Instructions

## Project Overview
NarrativeGen is an interactive story engine that allows users to create, edit, and test narrative models through multiple interfaces.

## Components
- **engine-ts**: Core TypeScript runtime engine for story execution
- **web-tester**: Web-based testing and editing interface
- **sdk-unity**: Unity integration SDK

## Current Specifications
- Model execution with state management (flags, resources)
- GUI model editing in web-tester
- CSV import/export for model data
- AI-assisted content generation
- Virtual scrolling for long stories
- Error validation for models

## Development Principles
- Specification-driven development using OpenSpec
- Tiered permissions: Tier 1 (low risk) for autonomous execution
- Pre-flight checks for all operations
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Priority Features
1. Visual model visualization (graph view)
2. Enhanced GUI editing capabilities
3. CI/CD stabilization
4. Testing framework improvements
